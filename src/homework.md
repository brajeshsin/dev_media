- What is middleware?
- A middleware is a function or software layer that sits between the incoming request and the final response in an application — it  processes the request before it reaches the main logic (and/or modifies the response before it’s sent back).

- Simple Definition:

Middleware is like a checkpoint that handles tasks such as authentication, logging, validation, or modifying requests/responses — before your main code runs.
